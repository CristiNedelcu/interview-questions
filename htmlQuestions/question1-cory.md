* What does a doctype do?

A doctype should be the first thing in an HTML document before the html tag. The doctype declaration in not an HTML tag, it simply tells the web browser which version of the markup language the page is written in.  It is an abbreviation for Document Type Declaration. Omitting this tag will trigger quirks mode in older browsers.
