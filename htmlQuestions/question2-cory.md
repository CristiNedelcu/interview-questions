* What's the difference between full standards mode, almost standards mode and quirks mode?

When web standards were made W3C, browsers couldn't implement them right away or they would break most existing sites on the web.  Browsers introduced two modes to treat new standards compliant sites different from legacy sites.

Today there are three modes quirks, almost standards, and full standards mode.  Quirks mode emulates the behavior in old Navigator and Internet Explorer browers.  Full standards mode emulates the behavior of the current web standards of HTML and CSS.  Almost standards mode implements a small number of quirks.

Which mode your browser uses is determined by the doctype at the beginning of the document.
