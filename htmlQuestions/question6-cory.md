* What kind of things must you be wary of when design or developing for multilingual sites?

1. How you are gonna handle switching the language and/or detecting their language when visiting your site.
2. If you use image replacement techniques that replace text elements, you will need one for each of the language you plan on supporting.
3. Date formatting
4. Line breaks and word lengths, some languages have longer word lengths than others.
