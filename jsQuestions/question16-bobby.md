* Explain Ajax in as much detail as possible.

`Ajax` is a set of web development techniques using multiple web technologies on the client side to create `asynchronous` Web applications. Using Ajax, Web apps can send and recieve data from a server asynchronously without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page.

By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows for Web pages and applications to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page.
