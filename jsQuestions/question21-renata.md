Describe event bubbling.

Event bubbling directs an event to its intended target, it works like this: A button is clicked and the event is directed to the button. If an event handler is set for that object, the event is triggered. If no event handler is set for that object, the event bubbles up (like a bubble in water) to the objects parent.
