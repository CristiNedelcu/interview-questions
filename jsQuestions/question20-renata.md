Explain "hoisting".

In Javascript, variable declarations are "hoisted" to the top of the current scope. Variable assignments, however, are not.

Remember: when you declare a variable in JavaScript (using "var"), that variable declaration is "hoisted" to the top of the current scopeâ€”meaning the top of the current function or the top of the script if the variable isn't in a function.

Hoisting can cause unexpected behavior, so a good way to keep things clear is to always declare your variables at the top of the scope.
