* What's the difference between host objects and native objects?

#### Host Objects

Objects that are supplied by a certain environment. Because of this, they are not always the same because each environment differs and contains host objects that accomadate execution of ECMAScript.<br/>

##### Example:

Browser environment supplies objects such as `Window`.


#### Native Objects

Standard built-in objects provided by JavaScript. Native objects are sometimes referred to as `Global Objects` since they are objects JavaScript has provided natively available for use.

##### Example:

The global `String` Object, `Array` Object, `Number` Object, etc.
