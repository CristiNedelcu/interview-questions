* Explain CSS sprites, and how you would implement them on a page or site.

CSS sprites are a way to combine multiple images into one image file for performance purposes.  How they work is you set multiple classes to use the same background image and then you can individually set the position of the image, causing the correct part of a big image to be displayed.
