* What's the difference between "resetting" and "normalizing" CSS? Which would you choose, and why?

  Resetting removes all built-in browser styling.  Normalizing aims to provide consistent styling across all browsers.  So instead of adding all the decorations yourself you would add the different styling for your needs.  I think they both have their use cases, if you have a complex design spec on a non-boilerplate type project you are going to want to reset.  But if you want to proceed a little faster with more web programming normalize might be a better choice.
