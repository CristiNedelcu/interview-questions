* What did you learn yesterday/this week?

This week, I learned that teaching JavaScript to beginners takes patience. When mentoring a student on solving a toy problem that would take me 10 seconds to solve, it's easy to become frustrated when the student doesn't get it. This feeling of frustration compounds especially when the student is unable to 'see it your way' after 4-5 different approaches to the problem.

After working with this particular student, it changed my mindset and shifted it to where I had more empathy and understanding. I was once at that point in my coding journey, and I should apply the same amount of patience and empathy that my mentors gave me.
