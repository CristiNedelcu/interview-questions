* Describe BFC(Block Formatting Context) and how it works.

  W3C defines it as a part of the visual CSS rendering of a web page in which block boxes are laid out. The positioning scheme to which it belongs is normal flow. Which means that if you want to start a new block formatting context you need to add a float, position, display, or overflow property.
